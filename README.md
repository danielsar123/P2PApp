# Peer-to-Peer Python Chat Application

This project is for Comp 429 class at CSUN and creates a P2P Python application which allows for many options including  connecting to other users with the knowledge of their ip address and port number, sending messages to the desired user they're connected to, terminating their desired connections, viewing all of their connections, and exiting the program when needed.   





## How to Use
Find the directory of the project, and run this line in command prompt: 
```bash
python chat.py 123 (you may enter any desired port number instead of 123)
```
