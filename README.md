# Peer-to-Peer Python Chat Application

This project is for Comp 429 and creates a P2P Python application which allows for many options including  connecting to other users with the knowledge of their ip address and port number, sending messages to the desired user they're connected to, terminate their desired connection, view all of their connections, and exit the program when needed.   





## How to Use
Find the directory of the project, and run this line in command prompt: python chat.py <enter port number (e.g. 123)>
